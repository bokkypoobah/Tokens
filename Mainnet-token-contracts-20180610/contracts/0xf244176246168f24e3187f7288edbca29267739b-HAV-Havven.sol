CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This court provides the nomin contract with a confiscation
facility, if enough havven owners vote to confiscate a target
account's nomins.

This is designed to provide a mechanism to respond to abusive
contracts such as nomin wrappers, which would allow users to
trade wrapped nomins without accruing fees on those transactions.

In order to prevent tyranny, an account may only be frozen if
users controlling at least 30% of the value of havvens participate,
and a two thirds majority is attained in that vote.
In order to prevent tyranny of the majority or mob justice,
confiscation motions are only approved if the havven foundation
approves the result.
This latter requirement may be lifted in future versions.

The foundation, or any user with a sufficient havven balance may bring a
confiscation motion.
A motion lasts for a default period of one week, with a further confirmation
period in which the foundation approves the result.
The latter period may conclude early upon the foundation's decision to either
veto or approve the mooted confiscation motion.
If the confirmation period elapses without the foundation making a decision,
the motion fails.

The weight of a havven holder's vote is determined by examining their
average balance over the last completed fee period prior to the
beginning of a given motion.
Thus, since a fee period can roll over in the middle of a motion, we must
also track a user's average balance of the last two periods.
This system is designed such that it cannot be attacked by users transferring
funds between themselves, while also not requiring them to lock their havvens
for the duration of the vote. This is possible since any transfer that increases
the average balance in one account will be reflected by an equivalent reduction
in the voting weight in the other.
At present a user may cast a vote only for one motion at a time,
but may cancel their vote at any time except during the confirmation period,
when the vote tallies must remain static until the matter has been settled.

A motion to confiscate the balance of a given address composes
a state machine built of the following states:


Waiting:
  - A user with standing brings a motion:
    If the target address is not frozen;
    initialise vote tallies to 0;
    transition to the Voting state.

  - An account cancels a previous residual vote:
    remain in the Waiting state.

Voting:
  - The foundation vetoes the in-progress motion:
    transition to the Waiting state.

  - The voting period elapses:
    transition to the Confirmation state.

  - An account votes (for or against the motion):
    its weight is added to the appropriate tally;
    remain in the Voting state.

  - An account cancels its previous vote:
    its weight is deducted from the appropriate tally (if any);
    remain in the Voting state.

Confirmation:
  - The foundation vetoes the completed motion:
    transition to the Waiting state.

  - The foundation approves confiscation of the target account:
    freeze the target account, transfer its nomin balance to the fee pool;
    transition to the Waiting state.

  - The confirmation period elapses:
    transition to the Waiting state.


User votes are not automatically cancelled upon the conclusion of a motion.
Therefore, after a motion comes to a conclusion, if a user wishes to vote 
in another motion, they must manually cancel their vote in order to do so.

This procedure is designed to be relatively simple.
There are some things that can be added to enhance the functionality
at the expense of simplicity and efficiency:
  
  - Democratic unfreezing of nomin accounts (induces multiple categories of vote)
  - Configurable per-vote durations;
  - Vote standing denominated in a fiat quantity rather than a quantity of havvens;
  - Confiscate from multiple addresses in a single vote;

We might consider updating the contract with any of these features at a later date if necessary.

CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ether-backed nomin stablecoin contract.

This contract issues nomins, which are tokens worth 1 USD each. They are backed
by a pool of ether collateral, so that if a user has nomins, they may
redeem them for ether from the pool, or if they want to obtain nomins,
they may pay ether into the pool in order to do so.

The supply of nomins that may be in circulation at any time is limited.
The contract owner may increase this quantity, but only if they provide
ether to back it. The backing the owner provides at issuance must
keep each nomin at least twice overcollateralised.
The owner may also destroy nomins in the pool, which is potential avenue
by which to maintain healthy collateralisation levels, as it reduces
supply without withdrawing ether collateral.

A configurable fee is charged on nomin transfers and deposited
into a common pot, which havven holders may withdraw from once per
fee period.

Ether price is continually updated by an external oracle, and the value
of the backing is computed on this basis. To ensure the integrity of
this system, if the contract's price has not been updated recently enough,
it will temporarily disable itself until it receives more price information.

The contract owner may at any time initiate contract liquidation.
During the liquidation period, most contract functions will be deactivated.
No new nomins may be issued or bought, but users may sell nomins back
to the system.
If the system's collateral falls below a specified level, then anyone
may initiate liquidation.

After the liquidation period has elapsed, which is initially 90 days,
the owner may destroy the contract, transferring any remaining collateral
to a nominated beneficiary address.
This liquidation period may be extended up to a maximum of 180 days.
If the contract is recollateralised, the owner may terminate liquidation.

CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This contract allows the foundation to apply unique vesting
schedules to havven funds sold at various discounts in the token
sale. HavvenEscrow gives users the ability to inspect their
vested funds, their quantities and vesting dates, and to withdraw
the fees that accrue on those funds.

The fees are handled by withdrawing the entire fee allocation
for all havvens inside the escrow contract, and then allowing
the contract itself to subdivide that pool up proportionally within
itself. Every time the fee period rolls over in the main Havven
contract, the HavvenEscrow fee pool is remitted back into the 
main fee pool to be redistributed in the next fee period.

CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Havven token contract. Havvens are transferable ERC20 tokens,
and also give their holders the following privileges.
An owner of havvens is entitled to a share in the fees levied on
nomin transactions, and additionally may participate in nomin
confiscation votes.

After a fee period terminates, the duration and fees collected for that
period are computed, and the next period begins.
Thus an account may only withdraw the fees owed to them for the previous
period, and may only do so once per period.
Any unclaimed fees roll over into the common pot for the next period.

The fee entitlement of a havven holder is proportional to their average
havven balance over the last fee period. This is computed by measuring the
area under the graph of a user's balance over time, and then when fees are
distributed, dividing through by the duration of the fee period.

We need only update fee entitlement on transfer when the havven balances of the sender
and recipient are modified. This is for efficiency, and adds an implicit friction to
trading in the havven market. A havven holder pays for his own recomputation whenever
he wants to change his position, which saves the foundation having to maintain a pot
dedicated to resourcing this.

A hypothetical user's balance history over one fee period, pictorially:

      s ____
       |    |
       |    |___ p
       |____|___|___ __ _  _
       f    t   n

Here, the balance was s between times f and t, at which time a transfer
occurred, updating the balance to p, until n, when the present transfer occurs.
When a new transfer occurs at time n, the balance being p,
we must:

  - Add the area p * (n - t) to the total area recorded so far
  - Update the last transfer time to p

So if this graph represents the entire current fee period,
the average havvens held so far is ((t-f)*s + (n-t)*p) / (n-f).
The complementary computations must be performed for both sender and
recipient.

Note that a transfer keeps global supply of havvens invariant.
The sum of all balances is constant, and unmodified by any transfer.
So the sum of all balances multiplied by the duration of a fee period is also
constant, and this is equivalent to the sum of the area of every user's
time/balance graph. Dividing through by that duration yields back the total
havven supply. So, at the end of a fee period, we really do yield a user's
average share in the havven supply over that period.

A slight wrinkle is introduced if we consider the time r when the fee period
rolls over. Then the previous fee period k-1 is before r, and the current fee
period k is afterwards. If the last transfer took place before r,
but the latest transfer occurred afterwards:

k-1       |        k
      s __|_
       |  | |
       |  | |____ p
       |__|_|____|___ __ _  _
          |
       f  | t    n
          r

In this situation the area (r-f)*s contributes to fee period k-1, while
the area (t-r)*s contributes to fee period k. We will implicitly consider a
zero-value transfer to have occurred at time r. Their fee entitlement for the
previous period will be finalised at the time of their first transfer during the
current fee period, or when they query or withdraw their fee entitlement.

In the implementation, the duration of different fee periods may be slightly irregular,
as the check that they have rolled over occurs only when state-changing havven
operations are performed.

Additionally, we keep track also of the penultimate and not just the last
average balance, in order to support the voting functionality detailed in Court.sol.

CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A contract that holds the state of an ERC20 compliant token.

This contract is used side by side with external state token
contracts, such as Havven and EtherNomin.
It provides an easy way to upgrade contract logic while
maintaining all user balances and allowances. This is designed
to to make the changeover as easy as possible, since mappings
are not so cheap or straightforward to migrate.

The first deployed contract would create this state contract,
using it as its store of balances.
When a new contract is deployed, it links to the existing
state contract, whose owner would then change its associated
contract to the new one.
